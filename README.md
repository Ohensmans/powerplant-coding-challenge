# powerplant-coding-challenge

## About the project

The project is done in C# the sln file is in \PowerPlantChallenge

I took into account that a gas-fired powerplant also emits CO2 (each MWh generated creates 0.3 ton of CO2).

## How to launch the API

You just have to launch on windows x86 the exe here : \PowerPlantChallenge\bin\Release\net5.0\publish\PowerPlantChallenge.exe

And then send a post request with a valid Json to http://localhost:8888/productionplan (to change the port just need to change url in the appsettings.json)

The docker image is here : https://hub.docker.com/r/ohensmans/powerplantchallenge

## Who am I

I am a motivated and committed person looking for a first exciting project. My drive is to learn new things and new process.

I followed my Bachelor in the evening while working full-time and managed to get a great distinction.
I am not afraid of challenges and always want to understand how things work and how to improve a process.

I believe in human and respect all people and their ideas. I am sure that a team is better than an individual.
